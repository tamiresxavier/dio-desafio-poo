## Challenge: Abstracting a Bootcamp Using Object Orientation in Java

💎The main objective is to put into practice one of the main tools of OO: ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, HERANCE AND POLYMORPHISM, through a Java project.

🛑 Prerequisites
✅Know the syntax of Java
✅Java JDK 11
✅IDE for Java development (I will use Visual Studio Code)
✅git
✅Account on GitHub

👣Step-by-Step
1. Abstract the Bootcamp domain and model its attributes and methods.
2. Create the classes: Bootcamp, Courses, Mentorships and Devs and relate them.
3. The Course, Mentorship and Devs classes will also be modeled, that is, their attributes and methods will be created.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
