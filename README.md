## Challenge: Abstracting a Bootcamp Using Object Orientation in Java

ðŸ’ŽThe main objective is to put into practice one of the main tools of OO: ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, HERANCE AND POLYMORPHISM, through a Java project.

ðŸ›‘ Prerequisites

âœ…Know the syntax of Java

âœ…Java JDK 11

âœ…IDE for Java development (I will use Visual Studio Code)

âœ…git

âœ…Account on GitHub


ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step
1. Abstract the Bootcamp domain and model its attributes and methods.
2. Create the classes: Bootcamp, Courses, Mentorships and Devs and relate them.
3. The Course, Mentorship and Devs classes will also be modeled, that is, their attributes and methods will be creolder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
